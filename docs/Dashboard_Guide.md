|--------|--------|
| **▶ Start Phase X** | Begin training the selected phase |
| **⏹ Stop** | Gracefully stop training |
| **🔄 Switch Phase** | Change to different phase config |

### Current Status Panel

- **Episode**: Current episode number
- **Total Steps**: Steps completed in current episode
- **Reward**: Running reward average
- **Training Time**: Elapsed training time

## Stability Tab

Monitor training stability and detect anomalies.

![Stability Tab](screenshots/dashboard_stability.png)
*Screenshot: Stability metrics and charts*

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Good Range | Warning Signs |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Policy Loss** | Decreasing trend | Spikes or divergence |
| **Value Loss** | Decreasing trend | Increasing consistently |
| **KL Divergence** | < 0.02 | > 0.05 indicates instability |
| **Entropy** | Gradually decreasing | Collapse to 0 = overfit |
| **Gradient Norm** | Stable or decreasing | > 1.0 suggests explosion |

### Stability Charts
- **Loss History**: Policy and value loss over episodes
- **KL Divergence**: Should stay within bounds
- **Entropy Decay**: Gradual reduction is healthy

### Alert System
- 🟢 **Green**: Metrics in healthy range
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Approaching warning thresholds
- 🔴 **Red**: Requires attention

### What to Do When Red
1. Check Gradient Norm - if > 1.0, reduce learning rate
2. Check KL Divergence - if > 0.05, reduce `ppo_epochs`
3. Check Entropy - if near 0, increase `entropy_coef`
4. Consider reverting to earlier checkpoint

## Environment Tab

Monitor ecosystem health and balance.

![Environment Tab](screenshots/dashboard_environment.png)
*Screenshot: Environment statistics*

### Population Metrics
- **Avg Prey**: Mean prey count per episode
- **Avg Predators**: Mean predator count per episode
- **Population Variance**: Stability of populations
- **Extinction Events**: Times a species hit 0

### Food Chain Balance
- **Prey Birth Rate**: Prey reproduction rate
- **Prey Death Rate**: Combined predation + starvation
- **Predator Hunt Success**: % of hunts resulting in meal
- **Starvation Rate**: Deaths from hunger

### Population Charts
- **Population Over Time**: Prey vs predator trends
- **Birth/Death Ratio**: Should stabilize near 1.0

### Healthy Ecosystem Signs
- ✅ Both populations stable (not trending to extinction)
- ✅ Predator population < Prey population
- ✅ Hunt success rate 10-40%
- ✅ Low starvation rates

### Unhealthy Signs
- ❌ Prey going extinct (predators too effective)
- ❌ Predators starving (prey too evasive)
- ❌ Wild population swings
- ❌ One species dominates completely

## Tips & Tricks

### Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Check Dashboard Every 50-100 Episodes**
   - Don't obsess over every step
   - Look for trends, not individual values

2. **Use Auto-Refresh During Active Training**
   - Set to 5-10 second interval
   - Keeps view current without manual refresh

3. **Export CSV Before Phase Transitions**
   - Saves metrics for comparison
   - Helps identify phase-specific improvements

### Interpreting Charts

**Noisy but Trending Up** = Good
- Some variance is normal
- Focus on rolling average direction

**Smooth but Flat** = Potential Issue
- May need hyperparameter adjustment
- Consider advancing to next phase

**Sudden Drops** = Check Immediately
- Could indicate instability
- Check Stability tab for red alerts
- May need to restore checkpoint

### Common Issues

**Dashboard Shows Stale Data**
- Click **🔄 Refresh Now**
- Check if training is still running
- Verify log file path is correct

**Charts Not Updating**
- Ensure Auto-refresh is checked
- Check interval isn't too long
- Try manual refresh

**Export CSV Fails**
- Check write permissions on destination
- Try different location
- Ensure sufficient disk space

### Performance Tips

**Slow Refresh**
- Increase refresh interval
- Close unused tabs
- Large log files can slow parsing

**Memory Usage**
- Dashboard caches trend data
- Restart dashboard periodically for very long training runs
